# Shower-Cycle
This is a cold shower water saving project.

BASIC IDEA: 

This a device that recycles cold shower water at the beginning of the showering process using a simple redesigned hose that contains thermisor. The hose may have a third tube or it may use the exsisting cold water valve. The device may return the cold water back to the cold water pipe of the house then to the boiler or it may transfer the cold water to a seprate container for using later.
